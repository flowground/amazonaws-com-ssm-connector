In this case, you could specify the following key name/value pairs:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>Key=OS,Value=Windows</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Key=Environment,Value=Production</code> </p> </li> </ul> <important> <p>When you install SSM Agent on your on-premises servers and VMs, you specify an activation ID and code. When you specify the activation ID and code, tags assigned to the activation are automatically applied to the on-premises servers or VMs.</p> </important> <p>You can't add tags to or delete tags from an existing activation. You can tag your on-premises servers and VMs after they connect to Systems Manager for the first time and are assigned a managed instance ID. This means they are listed in the AWS Systems Manager console with an ID that is prefixed with \"mi-\". For information about how to add tags to your managed instances, see <a>AddTagsToResource</a>.
